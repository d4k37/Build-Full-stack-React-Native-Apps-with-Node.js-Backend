# What is react native
A javascript framework for building native mobile apps

Its is based on react and has a lot of built-in components and APIs

It is used to develop applications for android and iOS, therefore it is crossplatform

The code we write for react native is actually compiled to a native code for both android and iOS


# Installing react native

## Expo CLI
* Managed Workflow
* Same instalation steps on mac, windows of linux
* Limited to the expo ecosystem

## React Native CLI
* Manually install and configure some dependencies
* The instructions are a bit different depending on the operating system
* Full Flexibility
* NB: You can always eject(switch) from expo to the React Native CLI
